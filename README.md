<h2>Rock Paper Scisscors</h2>
<p><h4>Rock paper scissors  is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 
These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). 
"Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.</h4><p/>

<p> Here is pictorial representation of how the three game elements interact</p>

 <h3>Problem statement : </h3>
<p>It is game designed for a single player vs computer. Majorly it a input from user. The user have to choose either rock , paper or scissors as input and computer randomly plays its part .   </p>
<h3>Implemented solution : </h3>
<p>Basically a class named Rps is created. The function game contains the logic of oth player and the computer.
A list of elements is created for computer to randomly choose between them . The list contains "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors". The user have to run the code using :

```python
rps.py
```
 When player is True, the execution stops and when its false the program asks for input whether "Rock", "Paper" or  "Scissors".</p>
